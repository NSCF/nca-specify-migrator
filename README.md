#### UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Scripts used for importing specimen data into Specify for the National Collection of Arachnida, so that we don't have to split large files into chunks. 

This was done as an alternative to using the Specify Workbench, due to the size of the original dataset (> 80 000 records).
